### Important Note:
The official Arduino BLE lib has crash (pointer exceptions) and hang issues; This patched version is used in the Sparky Project (do NOT use the official release). It's still not perfect, but is more stable. The patched arduino BLE library has been copied into the project's /lib folder:  
<project base directory>/PulseWelder/lib
  
The original source of the project can be found here:

BLE code is now included in Arduino. Source is maintained here:
